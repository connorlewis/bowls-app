## How to play: 

*Bowls*, which I've also heard called Fish Bowl, is a word game that requires each participant to "submit" 7 unique words or phrases. These words can be anything from **ball** to **losing track of time** to **stage left**. All of the *submitted* words get placed into the "bowl" and drawn randomly. The game consists of three rounds: 

1. Catch phrase style
2. Charades
3. One word clues   (ex. Giving the clue "jelly" for the word "peanut butter")

### Game Play: 

1. Each player opens their own instance (from the same deployment link) and submits seven words.
2. After all the words are submitted the player going first places all the submitted words in the **bowl** by pressing the black *Start/Restart* button. 
3. Player 1 presses begin turn and gets their team to guess as many words in a minute using catch-phrase-like clues. 
4. After 1 minute, the player ends their turn. Check the score, to make sure it calculated correctly. 
5. Player 2 from (team 2), then presses the green **Reload Words/Score** to update their instance of the application. 

### Rules: 

1. Only **ONE** pass of a word per **ROUND** for each team. Thus, only one word can be passed during the entire catch phrase, entire charades, and entire one-word rounds for each team. This does not mean you get one pass per player's turn. 

2. One minute time limit

3. House rules. 
  * Do you need to say the exact tense/form of the word?
  * Can props be used during the charades round? 
  * Does the first sound that is said during the one-word clue round, count as the clue?
